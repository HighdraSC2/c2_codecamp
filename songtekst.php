				  <p><span>
					I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
					And some kind of madness has started to evolve
					I, I tried so hard to let you go
					But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah
					I have finally seen the light
					And I have finally realized
					What you mean
					Oh oh oh
					And now, I need to know is this real love
					Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
					And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
					Like some kind of madness
					Was taking control

					And now I have finally seen the light
					And I have finally realized
					What you need
					Mm
					But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
					And I'm not expecting you to care (expecting you to care)
					That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
					I have finally realized (realized)
					I need to love
					I need to love
					Come to me
					Trust in a dream
					Come on and rescue me
					Yes I know, I can be wrong
					And maybe I'm too headstrong
					Our love is
					Madness

	  			<img src="img/queen.jpg" alt="item">
	  			<p>
					She keeps her Moët et Chandon
					In her pretty cabinet
					"Let them eat cake", she says
					Just like Marie Antoinette
					A built-in remedy
					For Khrushchev and Kennedy
					At anytime an invitation
					You can't decline
					Caviar and cigarettes
					Well versed in etiquette
					Extraordinarily nice
					She's a Killer Queen
					Gunpowder, gelatine
					Dynamite with a laser beam
					Guaranteed to blow your mind
					Anytime

	  			<p id="item2" style="display: none">
					To avoid complications
					She never kept the same address
					In conversation
					She spoke just like a baroness
					Met a man from China
					Went down to Geisha Minor
					Then again incidentally
					If you're that way inclined
					Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
					For cars she couldn't care less
					Fastidious and precise
					She's a Killer Queen
					Gunpowder, gelatine
					Dynamite with a laser beam
					Guaranteed to blow your mind
					Anytime
					Drop of a hat she's as willing as
					Playful as a pussy cat
					Then momentarily out of action
					Temporarily out of gas
					To absolutely drive you wild, wild
					She's all out to get you
					She's a Killer Queen
					Gunpowder, gelatine
					Dynamite with a laser beam
					Guaranteed to blow your mind
					Anytime
					Recommended at the price
					Insatiable an appetite
					Wanna try?
					You wanna try

	  			<p> 
					Is this the real life?
					Is this just fantasy?
					Caught in a landside,
					No escape from reality
					Open your eyes,
					Look up to the skies and see,
					I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
					Because I'm easy come, easy go,
					Little high, little low,
					Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
					Me, to me
					Mamaaa,
					Just killed a man,
					Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
					Now he's dead
					Mamaaa, life had just begun,
					But now I've gone and thrown it all away
					..

					Didn't mean to make you cry,
					If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
					Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
					Too late, my time has come,
					Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
					The time
					Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
					Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
					Mama, oooh
					I don't want to die,
					I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
					I see a little silhouetto of a man,
					Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
					Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
					Galileo, Galileo
					Galileo, Galileo
					Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
					I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
					He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
					Spare him his life from this monstrosity
					Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
					Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
					(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
					(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
					(Let me go) Will not let you go
					(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
					(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
					No, no, no, no, no, no, no
					Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
					Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
					For meee
					So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
					So you think you can love me and leave me to die
					Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
					Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
					Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
					Nothing really matters,
					Nothing really matters to me
					Any way the wind blows...

	  			<p>
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)
Another promise, another scene
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

(So come on)
Interchanging mind control
Come, let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

They will stop degrading us

… I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love
… My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
… Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love
… My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
And tired of living
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone

I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world
I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
